The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.) Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017 TITLE I--REGULATORY ACCOUNTABILITY ACT Regulatory Accountability Act (Sec. 103) This bill revises federal rulemaking procedures under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) to require a federal agency to make all preliminary and final factual determinations based on evidence and to consider: (1) the legal authority under which a rule may be proposed; (2) the specific nature and significance of the problem the agency may address with a rule; (3) whether existing rules have created or contributed to the problem the agency may address with a rule and whether such rules may be amended or rescinded; (4) any reasonable alternatives for a new rule; and (5) the potential costs and benefits associated with potential alternative rules, including impacts on low-income populations. Rulemaking notice requirements are revised to require agencies to:   publish in the Federal Register advance notice of proposed rulemaking involving a major or high-impact rule, a negative-impact-on-jobs-and-wages rule, or a rule that involves a novel legal or policy issue arising out of statutory mandates;  consult with the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) before issuing a proposed rule and after the issuance of an advance notice of proposed rulemaking;  provide interested persons an opportunity to participate in the rule making process;  hold a hearing before the adoption of any high-impact rule;  expand requirements for the adoption of a final rule, including requiring that the agency adopt a rule only on the basis of the best evidence and at the least cost; and  grant any interested person the right to petition for the issuance, amendment, or repeal of a rule.   A \\"major rule\\" or \\"major guidance\\" is a rule or guidance that OIRA determines is likely to impose: (1) an annual cost on the economy of $100 million or more, adjusted annually for inflation; (2) a major increase in costs or prices; (3) significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or the ability of U.S. enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises; or (4) significant impacts on multiple sectors of the economy. The bill defines: (1) \\"high-impact rule\\" as a rule that OIRA determines is likely to have an annual cost on the economy of $1 billion or more, adjusted annually for inflation; and (2) \\"negative-impact-on-jobs-and-wages rule\\" as any rule likely to reduce employment or wages in certain economic sectors or industry areas by specified amounts over specified periods. The bill specifies the minimum amount of information that must be included in an advance notice of a proposed rulemaking. After notice or advance notice of a proposed rulemaking, the agency making the rule is prohibited from: (1) advocating for the submission of information to form part of the record of review, (2) appealing to the public to undertake advocacy, or (3) communicating for publicity or propaganda within the United States in a manner not authorized by Congress. The agency may request comments or information in an impartial manner. The notice of final rulemaking that agencies must publish when they adopt a final major rule shall include a report, to be revised every five years, on the benefits and costs to regulated entities. If an agency determines in a revised report that the cost to regulated entities has exceeded the anticipated cost at the time the final rule was issued, the agency must submit to Congress an assessment of whether the rule: (1) is accomplishing its regulatory objective; and (2) has been rendered unnecessary considering changes in the subject area, other government regulations, and alternatives that might impose smaller burdens or achieve lower costs. Upon delivery of such an assessment about a rule exceeding the anticipated cost, the agency must: (1) reopen the public docket to receive additional comments, and (2) consider modifications or alternatives that reduce costs and increase benefits to regulated entities or individuals.  OIRA must issue guidelines to promote coordination, simplification, and harmonization of agency rules during the rulemaking process. The bill exempts from such revised procedures rulemakings that concern monetary policy proposed or implemented by the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) or the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).  (Sec. 104) The bill imposes new requirements for issuing any major guidance or guidance that involves a novel legal or policy issue arising out of statutory mandates. OIRA may issue guidelines for agencies in issuing major guidance or other guidance. (Sec. 105) The bill provides for electronic access to transcripts of testimony, exhibits, and other papers filed in a rulemaking proceeding.  The record of decision in a rulemaking proceeding must include information from a hearing under the Information Quality Act (IQA) or on a high-impact rule. Agencies must grant a petition for a hearing in the case of a major rule, unless the agency reasonably determines that a hearing would not advance consideration of the rule or would unreasonably delay completion of the rulemaking. Exempted from this requirement are rulemakings that concern monetary policy proposed or implemented by the FRB or the FOMC. (Sec. 106) An agency\'s denial of an IQA petition, or a failure to grant or deny such petition within 90 days, is reviewable by a court as a final action. The bill allows immediate judicial review of interim rules, other than in cases involving national security interests, issued without compliance with the notice requirements of this bill. (Sec. 107) The bill revises standards for the scope of judicial review of agency rulemaking to prohibit a court from deferring to an agency\'s: (1) determination of the costs and benefits or other economic or risk assessment if the agency failed to conform to guidelines on such determinations and assessments established by OIRA, (2) determinations made in the adoption of an interim rule, or (3) guidance. (Sec. 108) The bill defines \\"substantial evidence\\" for purposes of evaluating agency adjudications and for rulemaking under the APA as such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of the record considered as a whole, taking into account whatever in the record fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence relied upon by the agency to support its decision. (Sec. 109) The amendments made by this title shall not apply to any rulemakings pending or completed on the date of enactment date of this title.  TITLE II--SEPARATION OF POWERS RESTORATION ACT Separation of Powers Restoration Act (Sec. 202) This title modifies the scope of judicial review of agency actions to authorize courts reviewing agency actions to decide de novo (without giving deference to the agency\'s interpretation) all relevant questions of law, including the interpretation of: (1) constitutional and statutory provisions, and (2) rules made by agencies. If the reviewing court determines that a statutory or regulatory provision relevant to its decision contains a gap or ambiguity, the court shall not interpret or rely on that gap or ambiguity as: (1) an implicit delegation to the agency of legislative rulemaking authority, or (2) a justification for interpreting agency authority expansively or for deferring to the agency\'s interpretation on the question of law. No law may exempt such a civil action from the application of the amendments made by this bill except by specific reference to these provisions.  TITLE III--SMALL BUSINESS REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY IMPROVEMENTS ACT Small Business Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act (Sec. 302) This title amends the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) and the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Act of 1996 (SBREFA) to revise and expand the rulemaking requirements and procedures of federal agencies (excluding Congress, U.S. courts, U.S. territories and possessions, and the District of Columbia) that affect small entities.  The RFA is amended to adopt the broader definition of \\"rule\\" set forth in the APA, but to exclude from such definition: (1) rules that pertain to the protection of veterans\' rights and benefits and to consumer credit extended to service members and dependents, or (2) rules of particular applicability relating to rates, wages, and other financial indicators. The concept of \\"economic impact\\" is added to the RFA to require agencies to consider any direct economic effect of a proposed rule on small entities and any indirect economic effect on such entities that is reasonably foreseeable and that results from such rule. The applicability of the RFA is expanded to cover: (1) rules that have a beneficial significant economic impact on small entities, (2) rules that affect tribal organizations, (3) land management plans developed by the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management, and (4) certain collection-of-information and record keeping activities of the Internal Revenue Service. The definition of \\"small organization\\" under the RFA is revised to mean any not-for-profit enterprise, including a local labor organization, with a net worth not exceeding $7 million and with no more than 500 employees. (Sec. 303) Each agency is required to: (1) include in its regulatory agenda (published in the Federal Register every April and October) a brief description of the sector of the North American Industrial Classification System that is primarily affected by a proposed or promulgated rule that is likely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, and (2) prominently display a plain language summary of the information in the regulatory agenda on its website.  (Sec. 304) RFA requirements relating to an initial regulatory flexibility analysis are expanded to require an analysis to contain a detailed statement (instead of merely a statement) of information relating to a proposed rule. The analysis must include an estimate of the additional cumulative impact of the proposed rule on small entities, a description of any disproportionate economic impact on small entities or a specific class of small entities, and a description of any impairment of the ability of small entities to have access to credit.  A final regulatory flexibility analysis must include a detailed description of any disproportionate economic impact on small entities or a specific class of small entities.  An agency\'s certification that a rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities must include an economic assessment to support the certification.  The standard for measuring the economic impact of a proposed rule on small entities is expanded to require a quantifiable or numerical description of the effects of a proposed or final rule on such entities.  (Sec. 305) The authority of an agency to waive or delay the completion of regulatory flexibility analyses is eliminated.  The Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration (SBA) is given expanded authority to issue, modify, or amend rules governing agency compliance with RFA requirements and to intervene in agency adjudications. (Sec. 306) RFA procedures for the participation of small entities in the promulgation of a proposed rule are modified to require the rulemaking agency to: (1) notify the SBA Chief Counsel for Advocacy, and (2) provide the Chief Counsel with all materials prepared or utilized by the agency in making the proposed rule and with information on the potential adverse and beneficial economic impacts of the rule on small entities.  The Chief Counsel is specifically charged with: (1) convening a review panel with representation from the SBA Office of Advocacy, the agency making the rule, and the OMB; and (2) reporting to the rulemaking agency on the economic impact of the proposed rule on small entities with respect to energy and startup costs and on alternatives that will minimize adverse or maximize beneficial economic impacts on small entities.  The Chief Counsel is empowered to waive the review panel requirements if they are deemed impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.  (Sec. 307) RFA requirements for periodic review of rules affecting small entities are expanded to require: (1) mandatory review of all rules that have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities; (2) a detailed statement on how an agency will conduct outreach activities to include small businesses, including those owned and controlled by women, veterans, and socially and economically disadvantaged individuals; (3) annual agency reports on the results of its review of rules; and (4) annual publication in the Federal Register and on the agency website of a list of rules to be reviewed, with a solicitation of public comments.  (Sec. 308) Judicial review under the RFA is expedited to allow an individual who is aggrieved by an agency rule to initiate judicial review of agency compliance with the RFA without waiting for final agency action on such rule. (Sec. 309) Exclusive jurisdiction is granted to the U.S. Court of Appeals to review challenges by small entities to rules promulgated by the SBA Chief Counsel for Advocacy for implementing the RFA.  (Sec. 310) The Small Business Act is amended to: (1) authorize the SBA Chief Counsel for Advocacy to specify size standards for small business concerns for purposes of any enactment other than the Small Business Act or the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, and (2) permit a party who seeks judicial review of a small business size determination approved by the SBA Chief Counsel for Advocacy to join the Chief Counsel as a party in an action for such review.  (Sec. 312) The SBREFA is amended to require agencies, in developing small entity compliance guides, to solicit input from affected small entities or associations of small entities.  (Sec. 313) The Government Accountability Office (GAO) must complete and publish a study that examines whether the SBA Chief Counsel for Advocacy has the capacity and resources to carry out duties under this title.  TITLE IV--REQUIRE EVALUATION BEFORE IMPLEMENTING EXECUTIVE WISHLISTS ACT Require Evaluation before Implementing Executive Wishlists Act or the REVIEW Act (Sec. 402) This title prohibits a final agency rule from being published or taking effect until the agency submits the rule to OIRA and OIRA makes a determination as to whether the rule is a high-impact rule that may impose an annual cost on the economy of at least $1 billion. The agency shall publish such determination with the final rule.  An agency shall postpone the effective date of a high-impact rule until the final disposition of all actions seeking judicial review of the rule.  If no person seeks judicial review of a high-impact rule during any period explicitly provided for such review under the authorizing statute or during the 60-day period after the rule is published if no such period is explicitly provided, the rule may take effect as early as the date the applicable period ends.  TITLE V--ALL ECONOMIC REGULATIONS ARE TRANSPARENT ACT All Economic Regulations are Transparent Act or the ALERT Act (Sec. 502) This title requires each federal agency to submit a monthly report to OIRA for each rule such agency expects to propose or finalize during the following 12 months. The reports must include: (1) a summary of the nature of the rule, (2) the objectives of and legal basis for issuance of the rule, (3) the stage of the rulemaking as of the date of submission, and (4) whether the rule is subject to periodic review as a rule with a significant economic impact.  Each agency must submit a monthly report for any rule expected to be finalized during the following 12 months for which the agency has issued a general notice of proposed rulemaking. The reports must include: (1) an approximate schedule for completing action on the rule; (2) estimates of its cost, economic effects, and any imposition of unfunded mandates; and (3) a list of influential scientific information disseminated by the agency relating to the rule, including any peer review plans for the information. OIRA must make such monthly reports publicly available on the Internet.  OIRA must publish, not later than October 1 of each year, in the Federal Register: (1) information that OIRA receives from each agency under this title; (2) the number of rules and a list of each such rule that was proposed by each agency and each rule that was finalized by each agency; (3) the number of agency actions that repealed a rule, reduced the scope or cost of a rule, or accelerated the expiration date of a rule; (4) the total cost of all rules proposed or finalized and of any proposed unfunded mandates; and (5) the number of rules for which an estimate of the cost of the rule was not available.  OIRA must make publicly available on the Internet, not later than October 1 of each year: (1) the analysis of the costs or benefits of each proposed or final rule issued by an agency for the preceding year, (2) the docket number and regulation identifier number for each such rule, (3) the number of rules reviewed by the OMB for the preceding year, (4) the number of rules for which a review by the head of an agency was completed, (5) the number of rules submitted to the GAO, and (6) the number of rules for which a resolution of disapproval was introduced in Congress.  The bill prohibits a rule from taking effect until the information required by this title is posted on the Internet for not less than six months, unless: (1) the agency proposing the rule claims a \\"good cause\\" exemption from notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures under the APA; or (2) the President determines by executive order that such rule is necessary because of an imminent threat to health or safety or other emergency, for the enforcement of criminal laws, for national security, or to implement an international trade agreement. Such requirement becomes effective eight months after enactment of this title.  TITLE VI--PROVIDING ACCOUNTABILITY THROUGH TRANSPARENCY ACT Providing Accountability Through Transparency Act (Sec. 602) This title requires the general notice of proposed rulemaking by a federal agency to include the Internet address of a plain-language summary, not exceeding 100 words, of the proposed rule, which shall be posted on the regulations.gov website.","sponsor":"Robert W.

(Sec. 3) The bill revises provisions relating to congressional review of agency rulemaking to require federal agencies promulgating rules to: (1) identify and repeal or amend existing rules to completely offset any annual costs of new rules to the U.S. economy; and (2) publish information about the rules in the Federal Register and include in their reports to Congress and to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) a classification of the rules as major or nonmajor rules and a complete copy of the cost-benefit analysis of the rules, including an analysis of any jobs added or lost, differentiating between public and private sector jobs. A \\"major rule\\" is any rule that the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of the Office of Management and Budget finds has resulted in or is likely to result in: (1) an annual cost on the economy of $100 million or more (adjusted annually for inflation); (2) a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, federal, state, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or (3) significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or the ability of U.S.-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises.  A joint resolution of approval of major rules must be enacted before such rules may take effect (currently, major rules take effect unless a joint resolution disapproving them is enacted). If a joint resolution of approval is not enacted by the end of 70 session days or legislative days, as applicable, after the agency proposing the rule submits its report on such rule to Congress, the major rule shall be deemed not to be approved and shall not take effect. The bill permits a major rule to take effect for one 90-calendar day period without such approval if the President determines it is necessary because of an imminent threat to health or safety or other emergency, for the enforcement of criminal laws, for national security, or to implement an international trade agreement. The bill sets forth the congressional approval procedure for major rules and the congressional disapproval procedure for nonmajor rules. Agencies are prohibited from allowing a major rule to take effect without the congressional review procedures set forth in this bill.  A joint resolution addressing a report classifying a rule must be introduced as a major rule within three legislative days in the House of Representative and three session days in the Senate. The bill: (1) prohibits any amendments to such a joint resolution at any stage of the legislative process; (2) provides for expedited consideration of a joint resolution of approval; and (3) requires a vote on such resolution in the Senate within 15 session days after it is reported by the committee to which it was referred, or after such committee has been discharged from further consideration of the resolution. A court may review whether an agency has completed the necessary requirements under this bill for a rule to take effect (currently, no judicial review of a determination, finding, action, or omission in the rulemaking process is subject to judicial review). The bill limits the effect of a joint resolution of approval of a major rule. The bill is inapplicable to rules that concern monetary policy proposed or implemented by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee.  Any rule promulgated by a federal agency that relates to a regulatory program for a commercial, recreational, or subsistence activity related to hunting, fishing, or camping, or any rule other than a major rule for which an agency for good cause finds that notice and public procedure thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest, shall take effect at such time as the agency determines.  Before new rules take effect, agencies must amend or repeal other rules to offset any annual costs of the new rules to the U.S. economy. Over a 10-year period, agencies must submit reports designating for congressional review all agency rules that are in effect as of one year after enactment of this bill. If Congress does not enact a joint resolution of approval for such rules, the rules shall not continue in effect.  (Sec. 4) The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 is amended to provide that any congressional approval procedure set forth in this bill affecting budget authority, outlays, or receipts shall be assumed to be effective unless it is not approved in accordance with this bill. (Sec. 5) The GAO must conduct a study to determine as of the date of enactment of this bill: (1) how many rules were in effect, (2) how many major rules were in effect, and (3) the total estimated economic cost imposed by all such rules. The GAO must report to Congress on such study within one year of the enactment of this bill.

TITLE I--ENDING \\"TOO BIG TO FAIL\\" AND BANK BAILOUTS Subtitle A--Repeal of the Orderly Liquidation Authority (Sec. 111) The bill repeals the orderly liquidation authority of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The FDIC\'s orderly liquidation authority, as established under the Dodd-Frank Act, allows the FDIC to liquidate a failing financial institution if the institution\'s imminent failure threatens financial stability. Subtitle B--Financial Institution Bankruptcy (Sec. 121) Newly established provisions related to Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which generally involves the reorganization of a debtor\'s assets and debts, shall apply to covered financial corporations (certain large and complex financial institutions, as defined by the bill).  Under specified circumstances, a court may convert a covered financial corporation\'s Chapter 11 bankruptcy case into a case under Chapter 7 bankruptcy (also known as \\"liquidation\\" bankruptcy). (Sec. 122) The bill amends the federal bankruptcy code to establish Chapter 11 bankruptcy procedures specific to covered financial institutions. Specified federal financial regulatory agencies may appear and be heard in such cases. In making decisions in such cases, a court may consider effects on financial stability in the United States.

Subtitle C--Ending Government Guarantees (Sec. 131) The bill repeals the FDIC\'s authority, under the Dodd-Frank Act, to guarantee bank debt during times of severe economic distress. (Sec. 132) Current law generally requires the FDIC to utilize the least-costly method when using the Deposit Insurance Fund to resolve failing banks; however, in an exception to this requirement, the FDIC may take other action or provide assistance to avoid or mitigate serious adverse effects on economic conditions or financial stability. The bill repeals this exception. (Sec. 133) The Exchange Stabilization Fund may not be used for the establishment of a guaranty program for any nongovernmental entity. Subtitle D--Eliminating Financial Market Utility Designations (Sec. 141) The bill repeals the authority of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) to designate financial market utilities (i.e., payment, clearing, and settlement systems) as \\"systemically important\\" (also known as \\"too big to fail\\").  Under current law, entities so designated are subject to additional regulatory restrictions. Subtitle E--Reform of the Financial Stability Act of 2010  (Sec. 151) The bill repeals FSOC\'s authority to designate non-bank financial institutions as \\"systemically important.\\" In addition, the bill eliminates the Office of Financial Research, which is tasked under current law with supporting FSOC through data collection and analysis. The bill repeals: (1) provisions related to the authority of the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) to supervise and take enforcement action against non-bank financial companies; (2) the prohibition against management interlocks in certain financial companies (i.e., the prohibition against a management official serving simultaneously in two unaffiliated organizations); and (3) specified early-remediation requirements applicable to non-bank financial companies in financial distress. With respect to FSOC, the bill modifies council membership, voting procedures, open meetings requirements, and duties. In addition, the bill subjects FSOC to the congressional appropriations process. The bill exempts qualifying banking organizations from certain standards related to proposed acquisitions. In addition, the bill modifies procedures for: (1) the submission and federal review of \\"living wills\\" (i.e., companies\' plans for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of financial distress or failure); and (2) the stress testing of bank holding companies. The FRB may not, on an emergency basis, approve an application that would cause a company to become a bank holding company, unless the application involves the company\'s acquisition of a bank that is critically undercapitalized. Specified concentration limits applicable to large financial firms under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 shall apply only to banking organizations. (Sec. 152) A federal banking agency may not establish an operational-risk capital requirement for banking organizations unless the requirement: (1) is based on, and is appropriately sensitive to, current risks; (2) is determined under a forward-looking assessment of potential losses; and (3) allows certain adjustments. TITLE II--DEMANDING ACCOUNTABILITY FROM WALL STREET Subtitle A--SEC Penalties Modernization (Sec. 211) The bill amends the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Investment Company Act of 1940, and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to increase civil monetary penalties that may be imposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for various securities laws violations. With respect to a failure to comply with an injunction or order relating to a violation of one of these laws, each day shall be deemed a separate offense. (Sec. 212) The bill amends the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to increase civil monetary penalties that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) may impose upon registered public accounting firms or associated persons for violations of specified securities laws, board rules, or professional standards. (Sec. 216) The Government Accountability Office (GAO) must report on the SEC\'s use of its authority to impose civil monetary penalties. Subtitle B--FIRREA Penalties Modernization (Sec. 221) The bill amends the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), and other laws, to increase civil and criminal monetary penalties for specified violations involving financial institutions.  TITLE III--DEMANDING ACCOUNTABILITY FROM FINANCIAL REGULATORS AND DEVOLVING POWER AWAY FROM WASHINGTON Subtitle A--Cost-Benefit Analyses (Sec. 312) In general, a federal financial regulatory agency must include, in a notice of proposed rulemaking, a regulatory analysis as specified by the bill. Except at the direction of Congress, a federal regulatory agency may not publish a notice of final rulemaking if the agency, in its analysis, determines that the quantified costs of the proposed rule exceed its quantified benefits. (Sec. 314) A federal financial regulatory agency must make available on its website the data, methodologies, and assumptions underlying its required regulatory analysis such that its results can be substantially reproduced. (Sec. 315) A federal financial regulatory agency\'s chief economist must submit to Congress, and make available on the agency\'s website, a report that examines the economic impact of a regulation that is the subject of a notice of final rulemaking. (Sec. 316) Each federal financial regulatory agency must periodically submit to Congress, and make available on its website: (1) a plan to modify, streamline, expand, or repeal existing regulations so as to make the agency more effective or less burdensome in achieving its regulatory objectives; and (2) a progress report on the steps that the agency has taken to implement that plan. (Sec. 317) A person that is aggrieved by a regulation may bring an action for judicial review of agency compliance with the bill\'s requirements with respect to regulatory analysis. (Sec. 318) The bill establishes a Chief Economists Council, consisting of federal financial regulatory agencies\' chief economists, and tasks the council to report annually to Congress on specified issues related to regulations. Subtitle B--Congressional Review of Federal Financial Agency Rulemaking (Sec. 331) Before a rule may take effect, the promulgating federal financial regulatory agency must report to Congress and the GAO on any cost-benefit analysis of the rule and other specified information.  In general, a \\"major rule\\" (i.e., a rule with significant economic impact) promulgated by a federal financial regulatory agency shall not take effect unless Congress enacts a joint resolution of approval, as described by the bill. (Sec. 332) The bill establishes procedures for congressional approval of major rules. (Sec. 333) The bill establishes procedures for congressional disapproval of rules other than major rules. (Sec. 335) No action or omission under this subtitle of the bill shall be subject to judicial review, except that a court may determine whether an agency has completed the necessary requirements for a rule to take effect. (Sec. 336) A rule shall take effect at a time determined by the promulgating federal financial regulatory agency if: (1) the rule establishes or modifies a program related to hunting, fishing, or camping; or (2) with respect to a rule that is not a major rule, the agency finds that compliance with certain requirements is impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. (Sec. 338) This subtitle of the bill shall not apply to rules concerning monetary policy. Subtitle C--Judicial Review of Agency Actions (Sec. 341) In general, the standard for judicial review of an action by a federal financial agency shall be de novo (i.e., without deference to the agency). Subtitle D--Leadership of Financial Regulators (Sec. 351) The bill amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to modify the membership of the FDIC such that all five members shall be appointed by the President. (Sec. 352) The bill amends the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 to allow the President to remove the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) without cause. Subtitle E--Congressional Oversight of Appropriations (Sec. 361) The bill subjects each of the following to the congressional appropriations process:  the FDIC,  the FHFA,  the examination and supervision functions of the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA),  the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and  the nonmonetary policy-related administrative costs of the FRB. Subtitle F--International Processes (Sec. 371) The Department of the Treasury and specified federal financial regulatory agencies must satisfy certain notice and reporting requirements before participating in a process of setting financial standards as part of a foreign or multinational entity. Subtitle G--Unfunded Mandates Reform (Sec. 382) The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, which restricts the federal imposition of unfunded mandates on state and local governments, shall apply to federal financial regulatory agencies. In general, before promulgating a final rule that may result in a significant economic impact to state or local governments, a federal financial regulatory agency must prepare a regulatory analysis as specified by the bill. Each agency must develop a process to allow impacted parties within the private sector to provide input with respect to the development of regulatory proposals containing significant federal mandates. Subtitle H--Enforcement Coordination (Sec. 391) Federal financial regulatory agencies must implement policies and procedures to minimize the duplication of effort with respect to enforcement actions. Subtitle I--Penalties for Unauthorized Disclosures (Sec. 392) The bill amends the Financial Stability Act of 2010 to establish criminal monetary penalties with respect to: (1) an officer or employee of a federal financial regulatory agency who willfully makes an unauthorized disclosure of certain individually identifiable information, and (2) a person who willfully requests or obtains such information under false pretenses.  Subtitle J--Stop Settlement Slush Funds (Sec. 393) A settlement may not direct or provide for payment to any person who is not a victim of the alleged wrongdoing if the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Department of Justice, the Rural Housing Service, or a federal financial regulatory agency is a party to the settlement. TITLE IV--UNLEASHING OPPORTUNITIES FOR SMALL BUSINESSES, INNOVATORS, AND JOB CREATORS BY FACILITATING CAPITAL FORMATION Subtitle A--Small Business Mergers, Acquisitions, Sales, and Brokerage Simplification (Sec. 401) The bill generally exempts merger-and-acquisition brokers from registration requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Subtitle C--Small Company Disclosure Simplification (Sec. 411) The bill exempts from requirements to use Extensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) for SEC filings: (1) emerging growth companies (i.e., companies with revenues below a specified threshold); and (2) on a temporary basis, certain other smaller companies. (Sec. 412) The SEC must conduct an analysis of the costs and benefits of XBRL requirements with respect to such companies. (Sec. 413) The SEC must report to Congress on the results of its analysis and other specified issues related to XBRL implementation. Subtitle D--Securities and Exchange Commission Overpayment Credit (Sec. 416) If a national securities exchange or national securities association overpays certain transaction fees to the SEC, the SEC must credit the amount of overpayment to the exchange or association. Subtitle E--Fair Access to Investment Research (Sec. 421) The SEC must establish and implement a \\"safe harbor\\" for certain investment fund research reports published by brokers and dealers. Such reports shall be deemed not to be \\"offers\\" under specified provisions of securities laws, even if the broker or dealer participates in the registered offering of the investment fund\'s securities. In implementing the safe harbor, the SEC must prohibit a self-regulatory organization (SRO) from maintaining or enforcing a rule that would prevent a member from: (1) publishing or distributing a covered investment fund research report solely because the member is also participating in a registered offering of the fund, or (2) participating in a registered offering of a covered investment fund solely because the member has published a research report about the fund. The bill restricts the SEC from conditioning the safe harbor upon certain requirements.  Subtitle F--Accelerating Access to Capital (Sec. 426) The SEC must allow certain smaller companies to use a simplified registration form. Subtitle G--Enhancing the RAISE Act (Sec. 431) The bill modifies the requirements that must be met in order for certain accredited-investor transactions to be exempt from prohibitions against interstate solicitation.

(Sec. 821) The SEC must establish a process to allow a recipient of a Wells notification (i.e., a written notice that the SEC is planning to bring an enforcement action against the recipient) to make an in-person presentation before the SEC.

(Sec. 843) Current law requires shareholder approval with respect to an issuer\'s compensation of executives no less frequently than once every three years. The bill instead requires such approval only when there has been a material change to executive compensation from the previous year. (Sec. 844) Current regulations allow the resubmission of a shareholder proposal that has been previously included in the issuer\'s proxy materials if, when the proposal was last included, it received less than a specified percentage of the vote; this percentage, which varies depending upon the number of times a proposal has been previously submitted, represents the minimum threshold at which resubmission is permissible. The bill directs the SEC to increase this threshold. In addition, the SEC must revise its regulations with respect to the holding requirement for a shareholder to be eligible to submit a shareholder proposal to an issuer for inclusion in the issuer\'s proxy statement.  Specifically, the SEC must eliminate the option for a shareholder to satisfy the holding requirement by holding a certain dollar amount (under current regulations, $2,000).

(Sec. 848) The SEC must adhere to specified timeframes with respect to granting or rejecting an application for an exemption from requirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940. If the SEC denies such an application, it must provide the applicant with a written explanation and an opportunity for a hearing. (Sec. 849) Current law requires an issuer to establish a policy for the recovery of certain erroneously awarded executive compensation. The bill specifies that this requirement applies only with respect to recovery from an executive officer who had control or authority over the financial reporting that resulted in the error. (Sec. 850) The SEC may exempt a person from registration requirements applicable to a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSO) if: (1) such requirements create a barrier to entry into the market for, or impede competition among, NRSOs; or (2) such an exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and is consistent with the protection of investors. (Sec. 851) Under current law, the SEC\'s Office of Credit Ratings is required to conduct annual examinations of each NRSO. The bill specifies that such examinations shall be risk-based and removes the requirement that they be conducted at least annually. (Sec. 852) Current law requires each NRSO to disclose to the SEC certain information related to the NRSO\'s credit rating procedures and methodologies. The bill prohibits the SEC from: (1) mandating the specific organization of such disclosures, or (2) requiring that such disclosures include references to statutory or regulatory requirements. (Sec. 853) The bill repeals the requirement for each NRSO to include, with any credit rating it issues, an attestation affirming that: (1) no part of the rating was influenced by other business activities, (2) the rating was based solely on the merits of the instruments being rated, and (3) the rating was an independent evaluation of the instrument\'s risks and merits. The bill also repeals the requirement for each NRSO to include in its annual internal-controls report an attestation of its chief executive officer. (Sec. 854) The bill limits the applicability of certain look-back review requirements for NRSOs. (Sec. 856) A person who sells or markets the products or services of an NRSO may provide certain material information relating to credit ratings to a person who determines or monitors credit ratings, so long as the information is not intended to influence credit-rating determinations. (Sec. 857) The bill repeals provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that:  authorize the SEC to engage in investor testing;  authorize the SEC to restrict the use of mandatory pre-dispute arbitration;  provide for equal treatment of SRO rules;  with respect to short sales, establish specified public-disclosure and investor-notification requirements;  prohibit manipulative short sales of securities;  lessen requirements with respect to pleading state of mind in a private action against an NRSO;  apply the fair disclosure rule (which requires publicly traded companies to disclose material information to all investors at the same time) to NRSOs;  subject credit rating agencies to expert liability;  require an issuer to make specified disclosures;  prohibit covered financial institutions with assets in excess of $1 billion from using certain incentive-based payment arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks;  require the SEC\'s Division of Trading and Markets to employ a staff of compliance examiners;  allow the SEC to issue specified rules regarding proxy access;  allow the SEC to require a registered national securities association to establish a fee to fund the Governmental Accounting Standards Board;  direct the SEC to issue rules to increase the transparency of securities-lending information available to brokers, dealers, and investors; and  establish a grant program to support state efforts to protect seniors from fraudulent marketing.

Subtitle C--Harmonization of Derivatives Rules (Sec. 871) The SEC and the CFTC must review specified rules relating to swap markets. (Sec. 872) The bill exempts swap transactions between affiliates from swap rules issued by the SEC or the CFTC. TITLE IX--REPEAL OF THE VOLCKER RULE AND OTHER PROVISIONS (Sec. 901) The bill lifts the moratorium on the FDIC\'s provision of deposit insurance to industrial banks, credit-card banks, and certain trust banks. The bill eliminates the FRB\'s supervisory authority over securities holding companies. The bill repeals the \\"Volcker Rule,\\" which prohibits banking agencies from engaging in proprietary trading or entering into certain relationships with hedge funds and private equity funds. Current law prohibits an underwriter, placement agent, initial purchaser, or sponsor of an asset-backed security from engaging, within one year after the first closing of the sale of the asset-backed security, in a transaction that would involve a material conflict of interest. The bill repeals this prohibition. TITLE X--FED OVERSIGHT REFORM AND MODERNIZATION (Sec. 1001) The bill amends the Federal Reserve Act to require the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to, after each meeting, submit to Congress a Directive Policy Rule for open market operations that includes specified information and meets certain other requirements. (Sec. 1002) The bill restricts the type of public communications that FOMC members and staff may make regarding financial developments or monetary policy during a \\"blackout period\\" (i.e., a period extending from approximately one week before an FOMC meeting to approximately one day afterwards). (Sec. 1003) The FOMC must make full transcripts of its meetings available to the public. (Sec. 1004) The bill alters the membership of the FOMC.

(Sec. 1008) The bill limits the FRB\'s emergency-lending authority to cases in which the financial stability of the United States is threatened. Moreover, the FRB may not exercise its emergency-lending authority without the affirmative votes of at least nine Federal Reserve bank presidents.  The FRB must issue specified rules regarding: (1) the collateral required to secure loans made under its emergency-lending authority, and (2) the minimum interest rate on loans made under its emergency-lending authority. A borrower shall be ineligible to borrow from an emergency-lending program unless the borrower is certified by the FRB and federal banking regulators as solvent. (Sec. 1010) The bill removes specified limitations on GAO audits of the FRB and Federal Reserve banks. (Sec. 1011) The bill establishes the Centennial Monetary Commission and tasks the commission with studying specified issues related to monetary policy. TITLE XI--IMPROVING INSURANCE COORDINATION THROUGH AN INDEPENDENT ADVOCATE (Sec. 1101) The bill: (1) eliminates the Federal Insurance Office, which is tasked under the Dodd-Frank Act to monitor the insurance sector; and (2) establishes the Office of the Independent Insurance Advocate, which is authorized under the bill to provide coordination and consultation with respect to insurance matters.
